            Hi, I’m Nanami Hori — a passionate full stack developer currently based in Sydney, Australia.<br>
            I love building thoughtful, user-focused web applications that solve real-world problems.<br>
            I’m especially excited about working with globally minded teams and building tech that makes a positive impact — wherever I am in the world.
